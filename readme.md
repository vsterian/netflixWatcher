# Netflix Household Update Confirmation

## Description
This module provides confirmation for Netflix Household updates by fetching relevant emails from Gmail and processing them to extract necessary information. It utilizes Selenium for web automation to handle confirmation tasks.

## Setup
1. **Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, install the required Python packages using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install imaplib email selenium
    ```
2. **Chrome WebDriver**: Download the Chrome WebDriver compatible with your Chrome browser version and place it in the project directory.

3. **Gmail Credentials**: Provide Gmail credentials (`EMAIL_LOGIN`, `EMAIL_PASSWORD`) for accessing the inbox where Netflix update emails are received.

4. **Netflix Credentials**: Set Netflix credentials (`NETFLIX_LOGIN`, `NETFLIX_PASSWORD`) for logging in to confirm the updates.

## Usage
Run the script using Python. Ensure you have access to the internet as the script requires web access to interact with Netflix updates.

```bash
python application.py
```

## Workflow
1. The script connects to Gmail every 20 seconds to fetch unread emails.
2. If an unread email from Netflix is found, it extracts the body and processes it to confirm the Netflix Household update.
3. The confirmation process is automated using Selenium.
4. If any errors occur during the process, they are logged in the console.

## Error Handling
- If there's an IMAP error or a `ConnectionResetError` while fetching emails, the script will retry after a delay of 20 seconds.
- All other exceptions are logged in the console.

## Notes
- This project runs on a Windows container.
- Ensure the Chrome WebDriver is compatible with your Chrome browser version.
